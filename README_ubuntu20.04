cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/juce/fiveserver.git
cd fiveserver

Remove test database and access to it? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) {y}

All done!



**CONFIGURE MYSQL SO YOU CAN LOGIN AS ROOT USER WIHTOUT PASSWORD (OPTIONAL)**

Now you can login to mysql without a password (as long as you are logged in as root user):



**LOGIN TO MYSQL AND CREATE THE DATABASE**

mysql  {to login to MySQL server.  Then create the DB and import the sixserver DB with the following commands inside MySQL CLI]

create database sixserver;
create user 'sixserver'@'%' identified by 'proevo';
grant select, insert, update on sixserver.* to 'sixserver'@'%';
use sixserver;
source /opt/fiveserver/sql/schema6.sql

Make sure all is good and you get rows imported successfully.  If not, read again cos you've clearly fucked something.  If all is good, you can quit MYSQL:

quit;



**SET THE ADMIN USER AND PASSWORD**

vi /opt/fiveserver/etc/conf {{Then press i to insert and edit the User and Password as you see fit}}

AdminUser: fives
AdminPassword: fives

To quit, press Esc, Esc and type "wq!" (without the quotes)



**NOW YOU CAN RUN FIVESERVER**
